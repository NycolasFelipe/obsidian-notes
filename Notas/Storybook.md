## What is Storybook?
[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started) is a **frontend workshop for building UI components** and pages in isolation. It helps you develop and share hard-to-reach states and edge cases without needing to run your whole app. Thousands of teams use it for UI development, testing, and documentation. It's open source and free.

## Main concepts
Storybook is a powerful tool that can help you with many aspects of your UI development workflow. Here are some of the main concepts to get you started.
### [[Stories]]
A story **captures the rendered state of a UI component**. Each component can have multiple stories, where each story describes a different component state.
### [[Docs]]
Storybook can analyze your components to **automatically create documentation** alongside your stories. This automatic documentation makes it easier for you to create UI library usage guidelines, design system sites, and more.
### [[Testing]]
Stories are a pragmatic starting point for your UI testing strategy. You already write stories as a natural part of UI development, so testing those stories is a low-effort way to prevent UI bugs over time.
