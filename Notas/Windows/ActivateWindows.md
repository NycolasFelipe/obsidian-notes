# How to activate Windows

1. Press windows key and typed "cmd" in the search bar
2. Right click **"Command Prompt" and choose "Run as administrator"**
3. Click "yes" when it asks "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?"
4. Once in command prompt, copy the following text: `slmgr /ipk`
5. Paste it into command prompt and **do not press Enter on your keyboard**
6. Go into your windows search bar and type "System Information", then open "**System Information"**
7. At the top, it will say OS Name. Remember what your OS Name is, in my case it is "Microsoft Windows 10 Home". Dependant on what your OS Name is, copy the code from below.

```cmd

12. Then, paste this into command prompt: `slmgr /ato`
